# ESP32ToProcessing

This project is utilizing the SensorsToSerial repo, to create four interactions using an ESP32. There is a LED, button switch, and potentiomenter. The processing sketch flashes different colors, changes the speed and direction of text, and utilizes mouse pressed to make text appear on the screen. The LED also turns on when the switch is pressed.
